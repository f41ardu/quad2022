/*
Universal Servo Libary 
Works with almost any *tiny's

 *   This is a universal servo library for the Attiny/Arduino.

  See xxxxx code project for latest, bugs and info http://XXXX
  
  This library was inspired by my interest in objectoriented coding 
        and to understand to build my my own classes.  
  
  It provides a universal servo libary for atmel based microcontrollers
        based on Arduino commands supported on Attinys to avoid direct hw access 
        to Attiny's timers. 
        
        See http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695 for the excellent documentation of 
        Attiny support.
